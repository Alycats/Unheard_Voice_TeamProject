        <summary>Lesson 1</summary>
        <p>Before you start to coach a child that has autism, not every child is the same and what may work for one child doesn't mean it will work for the other child. Giving a child a series of steps to take in all at once will be difficult for them and quite overwhelming.</p>

        <summary>Lesson 2</summary>
        <p>To teach a child with autism sports to make things easier for the child to settle in meeting the child before the first lesson and showing the child the sports equipment that's about to be used ahead of time will also help. That way the child isn't hit with all the information all at once and shown the equipment which they could be unfamiliar with and told to repeat the action. The next step can apply with teaching all children, rather than just giving orders to the child and expecting them to know demonstrate what's about to happen and what you need to be done. And do so in small segments not all at once so it will be easier to learn the sequence.</p>

        <p>For each practice make sure to have a repeated routine you do every time so that the child gets used to that order and not having to adjust to change every session. When teaching a child with autism refrain from using sarcasm, metaphors and some humour as they could take it literal, and it may confuse them. And linking back to the not all children with autism are the same some may like the social aspect of team sports but other may dislike it and find it difficult make sure as a coach or a teacher you don't force it open them. And lastly stay positive, be patient the child will hopefully improve and through your positivity it can potentially motivate the child into becoming more into the sport.</p>

        <h>Picking a sport to teach</h>
        <p>Some sports don't require a high level of communication or even team play so certain sports will be more effective and similar to teach to children with autism which will also allow them to have fun. These sports are swimming, track and field, bowling, Horseback Riding, Hiking and Fishing, Biking and lastly martial arts. Remember to make it fun for the child as they will need to be motivated to take part or find interest in it.</p>
